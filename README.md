# VoipStorm Telemarketing

Have a quick look here to get a feeling: https://sites.google.com/site/voipstorm2/

Voipstorm is fast telemarketing / voicemessenger delivering up to 20,000 phone-messages per hour from your desktop.

VoipStorm is a fairly large and complex application, which consists of 3 major user interface components:

VoipStorm Manager:    Responsible for managing callcenters and campains
VoipStorm CallCenter: Responsible for running the campain using 500 multithreaded softphone implementations
VoipStorm SoftPhone:  The actual VOIP SoftPhone calling the recipient and delivering the voicemessage

VoipStorm is based on SIP/SDP & RTSP communication and requires a subscription to a VOIP Gateway Provider like Verizon
to convert to real phone calls to non VOIP based / regular telephones like landlines and cellular phones.

You'll find the necessary libraries in the "libs" directory
